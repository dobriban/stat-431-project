# Stat 431 project
 
This is the description of the final project for Stat 431, Spring 2020, at the University of Pennsylvania.
 
 The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has cut the academic year off and affected each of our lives. Given its urgency, a lot of work is being done to mitigate its effects. Some of that work, and some decisions being made, is informed by statistics. Given this, in this project you will aim to understand some aspect of how statistics is used to learn about Covid-19. 
 
 You will read a paper that addresses any aspect of the epidemic, and write a short summary/report/essay on how statistics is being used. There are many aspects of Covid-19 that use statistics, and you are free to choose what interests you most:
 
 
 ## Epidemiological aspects:
  - estimating the reproductive number of the virus
  - estimating the mortality rate for various groups
  - estimating the effectiveness of interventions like masks, social distancing in reducing the spread
 
 # Medical aspects:
  - estimating the need for various medical resources (beds, masks)
  - estimating the effectiveness of vaccinces and other treatments
  
 # Economic aspects:
  - estimating the economic impact and losses due to the virus (e.g., increase in unemployment rate, decrease in rate of growth of GDP)

For each (and many more aspects) there is an extensive body of scientific work being done. You only need to read one paper, and to your best ability, summarize the statistical aspects. Here are a few questions you should answer:

1. what is the goal of the study?
2. what type of data do they use? is it observational, experimental (refer to the sections where we studied this)
3. what type of statistical tools do they use?
 3b. how do they visualize the data? do they use histograms, boxplots, etc? is it compelling?
 3c.
